# GoodMQ

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/838239178/goodmq?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/838239178/goodmq)

A good `streadway/amqp` wrapper. Supporting connection reconnecting and channel recovering.

Thread Safeï¼šRecommend one thread one channel. One connection manage lots of channels.

### Feature

Need your issue and pull request to make this project more stable and stronger

- [x]  Auto recovering
- [x]  Publish message
- [x]  Ack/Nack
- [ ]  More flexible configuration
- [x]  Auto restart consume
- [ ]  Connection/Channel Pool
- [ ]  TODO

## Consumer Example

1. Connection will try to reconnect every 5 sec after close
2. When connection reconnect success, notify all channel recovering

```go
func ListenHeartbeat() {
	mq := goodmq.NewAmqpConnection(config.AmqpAddress)
	defer mq.Close()
	consumer, err := mq.NewConsumer()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer consumer.Close()
	consumer.QueName = "heartbeat.queue"
	consumer.Exchange = "apiServers"
	consumeChan, ok := consumer.Consume()

	//retry consume by yourself
	for range time.Tick(5 * time.Second) {
		if ok {
			log.Println("Heartbeat connect success")
			for msg := range consumeChan {
				m := string(msg.Body)
				log.Printf("Receive heartbeat from %v\n", m)
			}
			ok = false
		} else {
			log.Println("Heartbeat connection closed! Recovering...")
			consumeChan, ok = consumer.Consume()
		}
	}
	//or auto consume
	consumer.ConsumeAuto(func(delivery amqp.Delivery) {
		//do yours
	}, 5 * time.Second)
}
```
